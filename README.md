RED PCB with Black Pin (common before 2016 but still around)<br>
This is the first display I put hands on, has a resistor for backlight already mounted so I can supply directly 5V (but please do a fast check, chinese are famous for changes without notice). This display has 3v3 regulator for supply the ILI chip but logic levels remain at 3V3 so you will need a level translator for connect 5V logic level CPU (as arduino UNO).<br>

RED PCB with Yellow Pin (from Gen 2016)<br>
This is pretty similar to the display above but a bit smaller, however has different settings and offset is different. The Backlight led need a bigger resistor and cannot be connected directly at 5V.<br>
Rest of te connections are exact the same of the display above.<br>
Logic Levels are 3V3!<br>
